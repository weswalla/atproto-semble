[Semble](https://semble.so/) is a social knowledge network for research built on the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/).

In Semble, you can save links as _Cards_ to _Collections_ and discover what other users are doing in the _Explore_ tab.

Eventually, we will support _Collaborative Collections_, _Activity Feeds_ based on bluesky or semble following, _Follow_ Collections directly, _Notifications_, and a _Browser Extension_ for quick saving + _Web Annotations_.

Semble is being built by [Cosmik Network](https://cosmik.network/). Get involved [here](https://cosmik.network/#connect).
